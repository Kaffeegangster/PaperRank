# PaperRank
> Powering bibliometrics and citation analysis of academic literature graphs

PaperRank is a framework designed to enable bibliometrics and citation analysis of academic literature graphs. It is highly generalized and extremely extensible, and designed to be corpus-agnostic. Currently, it is configured for use with the [NCBI PubMed database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), but this can be modified easily.

This website contains an architecture overview, and implementation notes for the main components of PaperRank. For more detailed documentation, see the [GitHub repository](http://github.com/rukmal/PaperRank).
