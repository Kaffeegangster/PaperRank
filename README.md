PaperRank is a framework designed to enable bibliometrics and citation analysis of academic literature graphs. It is highly generalized and extremely extensible, and designed to be corpus-agnostic. Currently, it is configured for use with the [NCBI PubMed database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), but this can be modified easily.
